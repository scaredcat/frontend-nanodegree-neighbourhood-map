## Udacity Neighbourhood Map

This project was created for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program.

In order to view the project you can follow (this link)[https://scaredcat.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighbourhood-map/] or download the project and run index.html

This project makes use of the (Google Maps API)[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/] as well as the (Zomato API)[https://developers.zomato.com/api] to display the markers on the map.

The front-end interactions are handled through (KnockoutJS)[http://knockoutjs.com/] where users can filter the initially loaded results.

Further possible extensions to this project include:
* Adding more information on the info-window when a restaurant is clicked such as a URL and user rating.
* Adding matching colours for the list elements on the sidebar (so that they match those on the map)
* Re-doing the restaurant search based on the current maps location whenever the user moves the map
* Correcting the zoom-to-marker default functionality to place the focus of the map to the right side of the screen. This will prevent the sidebar covering up the marker.
